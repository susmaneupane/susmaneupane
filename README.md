Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a career-changer with a background in nonprofit management, customer service, and banking—now building my path into business analytics. I’m currently completing the Business Analyst program at [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com), where I’m learning to work with data, uncover insights, and tell clear, visual stories that help teams make better decisions.

I'm actively **looking for a Business Analyst or Business Intelligence role in the Greater Boston area**, where I can apply my practical experience, growing technical skills, and strong communication abilities to support data-driven decision-making.
